# Force-Dark-Mode Version 2
Invert colors in html via javascript

# Latest Fix

Support for emojis. This is to prevent emojis from being inverted in the opposite way.

# Bug

The only bug is in the case of emojis that are made up of double or more emojis like 💕,😘, etc. The structure is transformed to something like this �.
Aside from this, everthing is as expected. Only the rendering of double emojis are affected.
